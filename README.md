### Superhero app
 
You are building a superhero search application. The application has 2 screens:
 
* The first screen enables a user to search for a superhero. The screen should contain a text input field and a list of superheroes. When text input is empty an empty state is displayed. 
* The second screen is superhero details. The screen is displayed after a tap on a superhero from the list. You need to display the image, name, alternative name and biography data of the superhero. The user needs to have an option to go back to the search screen.
 
For superhero database use the API found here https://superheroapi.com/. To access the API you will need a facebook token. You can simply generate it from your account or use <10216351298848036>. 
The documentation describes multiple endpoints for different superhero resource. The https://superheroapi.com/api/access-token/search/name endpoint should be used for superhero search. Use other resources as necessary for implementing the app. 
 
Make sure you handle API errors in a graceful manner. This means displaying an appropriate message to a user and handle empty/error states on the screens. The app shouldn’t crash if something unexpected happens while fetching the data. 
 
The app should be compatible with Android 6.0+ devices. You can use a programming language of your choice (Kotlin/Java). You can use whatever third-party libs you like.
 
We want to see how you think and solve problems. You can use some of the design patterns such as MVVM, MVP, Clean Architecture, but you’re not required to. Maybe you have some better architecture for a specific problem?
 
The UX is also interesting to us, and we expect it to be usable.
 
If you need icons, you can use your own, default or download them from here: https://material.io/icons/ 
  
I hope you’ll find the assignment interesting and that you’ll use it to show us what you know.
